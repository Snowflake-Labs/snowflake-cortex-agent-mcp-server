The MCP Server is a [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) server that provides seamless integration with Snowflake Cortex APIs, enabling developers to get insights right where they develop applications, such as in [Visual Studio Code (VSCode)](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download). If you don't have VSCode installed, you can [download and install it here](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download).
